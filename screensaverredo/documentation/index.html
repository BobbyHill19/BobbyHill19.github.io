    <h1>
    Channel your Inner Wolf.
    </h1>

     <p>
    
I chose to include the items that I sell through my company, which with the javascript code I included causes a different item to appear depending on the day of the week.
<br>

My company itself: <a href="https://www.munch-fitness.com/" target="_blank">Munch Fitness</a> 
</div> uses the wolf as a trademark so I pushed the idea of inserting the actual products I sell into the environment of a wolf to hint at the idea that these products help you "channel your inner wolf." That was the conceptual part of the screensaver I chose to include so it's not just practical like you said it shouldn't be.
