  Bobby's Brushes
    </h1>

     <p>  
For the collection project my initial collection transformed from my multitude of paint brushes I own to the strokes each individual brush creates.
</p>

<p>
I categorized each stroke based on what type of brush it was made by and also made each different color stroke with a brush from the same category. For example, the strokes in the round category derive from my collection of round brushes and each colored stoked is from a different round brush that I own. </p>

<p>
When the user enters the site, a list of brush categories appear on the screen as well as strokes made from brushes in each category. The brush strokes themselves are draggable for the user. The reason for making the strokes draggable is that brush strokes mirror organic forms, so I believe they should have no set structure on the page for the user. The list of brush categories are links that direct you to a page that displays strokes from that brush category. Info on what that stroke category can be used for when painting is also available. In order to see the stroke/brush info, the user must hover over the first brushstroke from the series on the screen.
