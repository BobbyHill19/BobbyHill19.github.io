<h1>Yes, that's exactly what he did!</h1>

<br/>

<P> Bobby came to New York to attend Parsons the New School for Design, where he is currently a sophmore studying communication design.

<P> When King B first moved to New York he had to deal with a work study job that was barely getting him by. Who can possibly live off of $48 a week in NYC? That caused for King B to start his own business, known as "HillsWorks LLC". King B's company focuses in retail where he sells clothing merchandise based on his designs that are either graphically created or done by hand.</P>

<br/>

</P> Although the work-study job was not enough he did use it to develop cnnections, which allowed for him to speak at the United Nations for the 2016 business sustanablity summit because word had gotten out about his business.
